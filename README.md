# connect4

An app to play connect4 against AI

## Stock

p5.js

## About

This app uses the minimax alogrithm in order to "play" against a human opponent. The minimax alogrithm computes the future game outcomes at every turn and scores them to understand which is the best move. 

## Challenges

- Understanding the minimax alorithm and configuring the depths for app speed
- Setting up the board and searching for any possible wins
- Debugging an AI alogrithm, when you can't necessarily see why it is choosing a particular move

## Future Features

- Improving app speed with alpha beta pruning
- Adjusting the algorithm so that it does not assume you will always make the optimal move
